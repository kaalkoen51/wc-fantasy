"""Live in-match scoring loop for the Rugby Nations Championship league.

Designed to run from the "Live stats pull" GitHub Actions workflow,
which wakes it every 15 minutes (see .github/workflows/live-pull.yml):

- Nothing live and no kickoff within --max-wait minutes -> exits
  immediately (1-2 API calls, a few seconds of runner time).
- Kickoff within --max-wait (default 90 min) but not yet live ->
  stays alive, polling every --poll seconds; this bridges multi-hour
  gaps in GitHub Actions cron scheduling so nearby games are not missed.
- Kickoff time just passed but API hasn't flagged the fixture live yet ->
  stays alive for --kickoff-grace minutes (default 15) to absorb the
  typical lag before the provider marks a fixture as in-play.
- Otherwise it polls every --poll seconds: upserts player stats for
  every live fixture, gives each fixture one final pull when it goes
  full-time, and exits once nothing is live or imminent.

Every pull is a full cumulative upsert on (league, player, match), so
restarts, overlaps with the manual "Pull stats now" button, and the
06:00 daily sweep are all safe — the last write simply wins.

Environment variables: same as daily_pull.py (DRAFT_SPORT_KEY,
SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, FANTASY_LEAGUE_ID — one league uuid
or a comma-separated allowlist; every listed league gets the same rows,
at no extra provider cost).
