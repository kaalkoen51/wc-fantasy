"""Build injuries.json — availability hints shown as badges in the app.

Fetches API-Football's injury reports for the tournament, maps each player
to their FIFA squad-list id via the same matcher daily_pull.py uses, and
writes a small JSON the app loads optionally (like fixtures.json):

    [{"player_id": "mex_9", "status": "out", "reason": "Knee Injury",
      "fixture_date": "2026-06-18"}, ...]

"out" = reported missing a fixture; "doubtful" = questionable. The app
auto-expires entries whose fixture_date has passed, so a stale file fails
soft (no badges) and never affects scoring or league data.

Run by .github/workflows/injuries.yml daily; needs API_FOOTBALL_KEY.
